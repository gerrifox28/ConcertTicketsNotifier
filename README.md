# searchstubhub

A Chrome web scraper Flask API built using Python and Selenium that when given search inputs to Stubhub and filters for tickets, searches the top stubhub event and flags tickets that match the user's preferences. 

Saves the user from having to scroll through Stubhub infinitely themselves looking for their perfect ticket having their exact price point, location, and quantity.
